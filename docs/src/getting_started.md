# Getting Started

[ChainRulesCore.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ChainRulesCore.jl) is a light-weight dependency for defining sensitivities for functions in your packages, without you needing to depend on ChainRules itself.

[ChainRules.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ChainRules.jl) provides the full functionality, including sensitivities for Base Julia and standard libraries.
